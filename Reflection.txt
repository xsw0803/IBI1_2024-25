This is an example file for reflection in IBI1_2024-25.

During this course, I have learnt version control, how to navigate Unix-like systems and how to write simple programs in Python.

I have also learnt to write careful instructions when communicating online!

I make a website at https://xsw0803.github.io.
I've got basic understanding of branch, revert, add, commit and push(each add and commit before) .
But fetch, pull and merge still remain problems, needing more exercises.
