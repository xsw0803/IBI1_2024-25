Problem: Plot a boxplot of DALYs across countries in 1990.

Solution lines: 57 - 64 lines

Results: A boxplot od DALYs across conutries in 1990.
    The results meet my expectation.
    I select all DALYs data which is in 1990, the put them in a new variables as series 'dalys_1990'.
    To draw the boxplot to show the distribution of basic statistic state of DALYs in 1990, dalys_1990
    serve as the y values and become the only group.


Second problem: What country or countries have recorded a DALYs greater than 650,000 in a single year?

Solution lines: 67 - 68 line

Results: I don't run it and leave it as a comment. But if running,
it will show the countries have a a DALYs greater than 650,000. And the country is Rwanda.
